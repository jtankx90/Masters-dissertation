# Masters dissertation
 A copy of my master's dissertation and codes written in MATLAB

##Note:
The codes are categorised into 2 folders - To be run and Functions

To be run folder contains the code that is used to generate the results:

In_sample_data_analysis for in-sample analysis
HS_plot for the Historical Simulation Analysis

Without Bootstrap
Condvol_T for the parametric method without Bootstrap
Condvol_FHS for the semi-parametric method without Bootstrap

With Bootstrap
Condvol_iid_T for the parametric
Condvol_iid_FHS_T for the semi-parametric
HS_iid for Historical simulation 


Functions folder contains the functions written - do not have to be run.
